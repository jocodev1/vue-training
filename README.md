# vue-training

> A site to provide documentation / training materials for Vue JS.

## Purpose

> The objective of this site is to outline some popular Vue concepts. Vue documentation is already very well written, so the explanations here are very brief and conceptual. There are also some references to Laravel in case you are trying to learn how to use Vue with Laravel.

> The site also provides a vue development environment so you can make changes to the slideshow and see how Vue works on your own.

## Build Setup

> This package was created using vue-cli

> After cloning this repo, you will need to install dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

> Then to run the site, start the development server.

> The following command will use webpack to bundle the js and start a development server. With the site in your browser, you can now read the instructions. Most importantly, you also have access to edit and save the files in this app and immediately see the changes using webpack's hot reloading, which comes pre-configured with vue-cli.

```sh
$ npm run dev
```
